# AI Safety Monitor YOLO-v8 Based PPE Detection in Video Footage
Advanced AI-driven system designed to enhance safety compliance in the workplace. It employs the power of the YOLO v8 model, trained on custom datasets, to analyze video inputs in real-time or post-recording.

The system intelligently identifies individuals in the video and evaluates their adherence to safety regulations by detecting the presence or absence of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) like safety vests and helmets. This includes a thorough analysis of the video frame-by-frame to ensure no detail is overlooked.

The output is provided in the form of an annotated video, clearly highlighting individuals and the detected PPE for easy review and follow-up. This innovative project aims to mitigate workplace risks, improve safety compliance, and, ultimately, save lives by alerting relevant parties of any safety violations swiftly and accurately.

Through its robust functionality, "AI Safety Monitor" serves as a reliable and efficient tool for safety officers, workplace supervisors, and other stakeholders committed to maintaining a safe and secure working environment.
